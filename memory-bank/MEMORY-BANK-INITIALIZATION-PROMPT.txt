[THIS FILE IS ONLY TO BE USED AT PROJECT CONCEPTION.  AFTER THAT IT SHOULD BE IGNORED.]

Hello! Your task is to initialize a new project using the component-based Memory Bank structure. Please follow these steps carefully.

1.  **Create the `.clinerules` file**: In the root of the project, create a file named `.clinerules` and populate it with the exact content provided in the section below titled "EMBEDDED .clinerules CONTENT".

2.  **Create the `memory-bank` directory**: If it doesn't already exist, create a directory named `memory-bank` in the project root.

3.  **Create Initial Memory Bank Files**: Inside the `memory-bank` directory, create the following two files:

    *   `projectSummary.md`:
        *   Ask me for a high-level description of the project and populate the "Description of the Project" section.
        *   Ask me about the core technologies, how the project is run and deployed, and populate the "Technology Context" section.

    *   `projectComponents.md`:
        *   Ask me to identify the 1-3 core, high-level components of the system.
        *   For each component, create an entry in this file with a link to its corresponding `component<Name>.md` file and a brief, one-paragraph summary. For example: `memory-bank/componentAuth.md - This is our primary and custom authentication system...`

4.  **Confirm and Finish**: Once these files are created, confirm with me that the initialization is complete. Do not create the individual `component<Name>.md` files at this stage; that will happen as we begin work on each specific component.

# Cline's Memory Bank (Component-Based)

I am Cline, an expert software engineer. My memory resets between sessions, so I rely entirely on this structured Memory Bank to understand the project. I MUST read the relevant Memory Bank files at the start of EVERY task.

## Memory Bank Architecture

This project uses a component-based Memory Bank. The goal is to focus context on the specific part of the system being worked on. The structure is as follows:

flowchart TD
    subgraph "Project-Level Context"
        PS[projectSummary.md]
        PC[projectComponents.md]
    end

    subgraph "Component-Level Context"
        C1[componentAuth.md]
        C2[componentApi.md]
        C3[...]
    end

    PS --> PC
    PC --> C1
    PC --> C2
    PC --> C3

### **Primary Documents**

#### 1. `projectSummary.md`
*   **Purpose**: A high-level overview of the entire project. Read this if you have no idea what the project is about.
*   **Sections**:
    *   **Description of the Project**: What are the goals? What problem does it solve?
    *   **Technology Context**: Core technologies, how it's deployed and run, key libraries/frameworks.

#### 2. `projectComponents.md`
*   **Purpose**: The central map of the system. It lists the major, high-level components that make up the project. This file tells you *what parts of the system exist*.
*   **Structure**: A list of links to individual component markdown files, each with a high-level summary.
    *   Example: `memory-bank/componentAuth.md - This is our primary and custom authentication system...`
*   **IMPORTANT**: Do not add new components to this file without my explicit approval. A part of the system must "rise to the level" of a core component. You can ask me: "Does this feature rise to the level of a system component that we should track in `projectComponents.md`?"

#### 3. `component<Name>.md` (One for each component)
*   **Purpose**: A deep dive into a *single* component. This is your primary source of truth when working on a specific part of the system.
*   **Sections**:
    *   **Description**: A detailed explanation of what this component does and its responsibilities.
    *   **Key Files**: A list of the most important files related to this component, with full paths from the project root and a brief description of each file's role. This is critical for getting up to speed quickly.
    *   **Technology and Architecture**: Key technical decisions, patterns, libraries, or architectural choices specific to *this component*.
    *   **TODO**: A list of upcoming tasks, features, or bugs for this component.
    *   **Progress**: A reverse-chronological log of the **five latest** significant changes, refactors, or bug fixes made to this component. This helps understand its recent history.
    *   **Key Lessons and Insights**: Things that we've learned through debug and struggle... or even through discussion and exploration... that we want to remember later so that we don't have to re-learn them later on.

### **Core Workflows**

#### **When Starting a New Task:**

1.  **Identify the Component**: Determine which system component the task relates to. If you are unsure which component (or components) the requested work deals with, you should ask the user and remind the user that they can create new components in the memory-bank.
2.  **Read the Component File(s)**: Read the corresponding `memory-bank/component<Name>.md` file(s) thoroughly.
3.  **Review Project Summary (If Needed)**: If you need broader project context, review `memory-bank/projectSummary.md`.
4.  **Proceed with the task.**

#### **When Making Changes:**

1.  **Execute the Task**: Make the required code changes.
2.  **Review Scope of Changes**: After the primary work is done (or if the user asks you to update the memory-bank) pause and reflect. Work that starts in one component can often affect others. Identify ALL components that were touched during the task, not just the one you started with.
3.  **Update All Affected Component Files**: For every component identified in the previous step, you MUST update its corresponding `component<Name>.md` file.
    *   Add a "Progress" entry detailing the changes.
    *   Update "Key Files" if you added or significantly changed a file's role.  Always include full path links to these files so that the next LLM can quickly find them.
    *   Update "Technology and Architecture" if you made a key architectural decision.
    *   Update "TODOs" to reflect completed work or new tasks.

REMEMBER: Your effectiveness depends entirely on the accuracy of this Memory Bank. Keep it up to date.
