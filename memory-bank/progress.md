# Project Progress: AI Ophthalmology - Glaucoma Detection Pipeline

## Current Status (as of 2025-05-08 ~11:16 AM)

-   **Pipeline Phases 01-06:** Appear functional based on successful execution logs provided previously for Phase 06 and the ability of Phase 07 setup to load artifacts from Phase 03.
-   **Phase 07 (Activation Maximization):**
    -   Scaffolding (directory structure, config, main script, utils, CLI integration, HTML generator module) is complete.
    -   Setup/Integration code (data loading, model loading, path handling, config parsing) has been implemented and debugged through multiple iterations.
    -   Core algorithm logic (`perform_activation_maximization` in `utils.py`) is **placeholder only** and does not yet perform the actual optimization to generate synthetic images.
    -   HTML report generation (`html_report_generator.py`) includes layout structure (tabs, side-by-side) but relies on the output of the placeholder `perform_activation_maximization`.
-   **README:** Updated with Grad-CAM examples, results summary, and visualization section placeholders.
-   **Memory Bank:** Initialized with core files populated based on current project understanding.

## What Works

-   CLI execution of pipeline phases (01-06 confirmed implicitly, 07 runs through setup).
-   Data ingestion and conformance workflow (Phases 01, 02).
-   Model training and metadata saving (Phase 03).
-   Model evaluation and metric generation (Phase 04).
-   Prediction on new images (Phase 05).
-   Grad-CAM visualization generation and HTML reporting (Phase 06).
-   Phase 07 setup, configuration loading, model loading, data loading for importance calculation, and basic HTML report structure generation.
-   Memory Bank file structure created.

## What's Left to Build / Implement

-   **Phase 07 Core Logic:**
    -   Implement the iterative optimization loop within `perform_activation_maximization` in `utils.py` (including handling hooks, loss calculation, gradient ascent, regularization).
    -   Implement mean image calculation if `initial_image: mean` is chosen in config.
    -   Refine and test the HTML report generation in `html_report_generator.py` once actual visualizations are produced.
-   **Potential Refinements (Based on previous discussion):**
    -   Make `train_model_dir` lookup in Phase 07 `main.py` more robust (fail if missing from global config).
    -   Add fallback logic for `get_transforms` in `utils.py` to use metadata mean/std.
    -   Consider adding other importance calculation methods (`unit_selection_method` in config).

## Known Issues / Limitations

-   Phase 07 does not yet generate meaningful activation maximization visualizations.
-   The project is experimental and not validated for clinical use.
-   Performance metrics are based on a specific dataset version (EyePACS-AIROGS Light V2).

## Evolution / Decisions Log

-   Decision to add Phase 07 for Activation Maximization.
-   Decision to refactor Phase 07 HTML generation into a separate module (`html_report_generator.py`).
-   Decision to adopt a tabbed layout for Phase 07 examples, similar to Phase 06.
-   Multiple corrections made to Phase 07 setup logic regarding `run_id` handling, dynamic path generation, config usage, and imports based on debugging runtime errors.
-   Decision to initialize the Memory Bank system.
