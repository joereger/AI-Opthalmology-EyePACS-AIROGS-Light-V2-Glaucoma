# Project Progress: AI Ophthalmology - Glaucoma Detection Pipeline

## Current Status (as of 2025-05-08 ~11:16 AM)

-   **Pipeline Phases 01-06:** Appear functional based on successful execution logs provided previously for Phase 06 and the ability of Phase 07 setup to load artifacts from Phase 03.
-   **Pipeline Phases 01-06:** Appear functional.
-   **Phase 07 (Activation Maximization):**
    -   Scaffolding (directory structure, config, main script, utils, CLI integration, HTML generator module) is complete.
    -   Setup/Integration code (data loading, model loading, path handling, config parsing) is implemented and debugged.
    -   Importance score calculation (`calculate_importance_scores` in `utils.py`) is implemented (loads validation data, filters positive class, runs model with hooks, calculates mean activations).
    -   Real example finding (`find_real_examples` in `utils.py`) is implemented (loads validation data, runs model with hooks, finds/copies high/low activation images).
    -   Core activation maximization optimization loop (`perform_activation_maximization` in `utils.py`) is **still placeholder** and needs implementation (gradient ascent, regularization etc.).
    -   HTML report generation (`html_report_generator.py`) has the correct structure (tabs, layout) but currently displays placeholder/no synthetic images.
-   **README:** Updated with Grad-CAM examples, results summary, and visualization sections.
-   **Memory Bank:** Initialized and updated.

## What Works

-   CLI execution of pipeline phases (01-06 confirmed implicitly, 07 runs through setup).
-   Data ingestion and conformance workflow (Phases 01, 02).
-   Model training and metadata saving (Phase 03).
-   Model evaluation and metric generation (Phase 04).
-   Prediction on new images (Phase 05).
-   Grad-CAM visualization generation and HTML reporting (Phase 06).
-   Phase 07 setup, configuration loading, model loading, data loading, importance calculation, real example finding, and HTML report structure generation.
-   Memory Bank file structure created and populated.
-   README updated with examples and results.

## What's Left to Build / Implement

-   **Phase 07 Core Logic:**
    -   Implement the iterative optimization loop within `perform_activation_maximization` in `utils.py` (gradient ascent, regularization, image saving).
    -   Implement mean image calculation (`initial_image: mean` option).
-   **Potential Refinements (Based on previous discussion):**
    -   Make `train_model_dir` lookup in Phase 07 `main.py` more robust.
    -   Add fallback logic for `get_transforms` in `utils.py`.
    -   Consider adding other importance calculation methods (`unit_selection_method` in config).

## Known Issues / Limitations

-   Phase 07 `perform_activation_maximization` function is not implemented; no synthetic visualizations are generated yet.
-   The project is experimental and not validated for clinical use.
-   Performance metrics are based on a specific dataset version (EyePACS-AIROGS Light V2).

## Evolution / Decisions Log

-   Decision to add Phase 07 for Activation Maximization.
-   Decision to refactor Phase 07 HTML generation into a separate module (`html_report_generator.py`).
-   Decision to adopt a tabbed layout for Phase 07 examples, similar to Phase 06.
-   Multiple corrections made to Phase 07 setup logic regarding `run_id` handling, dynamic path generation, config usage, and imports based on debugging runtime errors.
-   Decision to initialize the Memory Bank system.
